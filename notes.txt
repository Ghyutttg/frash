NP_Initialize(a, b, c)
a.size >= 0xd4
b is filled in with a bunch of stuff starting with two halves - so pluginfuncs
c is some bullshit object [[it],0x36c](&object2)
object2 gets a lot of stuff called
0x10004
1
0x10004 // JNI_VERSION_1_4

that gets me a JNIEnv, which is called
0x58 - NewGlobalRef
0x54 - DeleteGlobalRef
